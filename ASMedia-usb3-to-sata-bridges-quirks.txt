Josh, I'm afraid it is not as simple as adding a quirk, the asmedia usb3<->sata bridges are very populair, and only the first generation has issues. 
Unfortunately one usb-id is used for all generations, so we have this beautiful code in the kernel to figure out what to do:

        /*
         * ASMedia has a number of usb3 to sata bridge chips, at the time of
         * this writing the following versions exist:
         * ASM1051 - no uas support version
         * ASM1051 - with broken (*) uas support
         * ASM1053 - with working uas support, but problems with large xfers   
         * ASM1153 - with working uas support
         *
         * Devices with these chips re-use a number of device-ids over the
         * entire line, so the device-id is useless to determine if we're
         * dealing with an ASM1051 (which we want to avoid).
         * 
         * The ASM1153 can be identified by config.MaxPower == 0,
         * where as the ASM105x models have config.MaxPower == 36.
         *
         * Differentiating between the ASM1053 and ASM1051 is trickier, when
         * connected over USB-3 we can look at the number of streams supported,
         * ASM1051 supports 32 streams, where as early ASM1053 versions support
         * 16 streams, newer ASM1053-s also support 32 streams, but have a
         * different prod-id.
         *
         * (*) ASM1051 chips do work with UAS with some disks (with the
         *     US_FL_NO_REPORT_OPCODES quirk), but are broken with other disks
         */
        if (le16_to_cpu(udev->descriptor.idVendor) == 0x174c &&
                        (le16_to_cpu(udev->descriptor.idProduct) == 0x5106 ||
                         le16_to_cpu(udev->descriptor.idProduct) == 0x55aa)) {
                if (udev->actconfig->desc.bMaxPower == 0) {
                        /* ASM1153, do nothing */
                } else if (udev->speed < USB_SPEED_SUPER) {
                        /* No streams info, assume ASM1051 */
                        flags |= US_FL_IGNORE_UAS;
                } else if (usb_ss_max_streams(&eps[1]->ss_ep_comp) == 32) {
                        /* Possibly an ASM1051, disable uas */
                        flags |= US_FL_IGNORE_UAS;
                } else {
                        /* ASM1053, these have issues with large transfers */
                        flags |= US_FL_MAX_SECTORS_240;
                }
        }


Note that this already checks for the usb-id used by the reporter's device.
