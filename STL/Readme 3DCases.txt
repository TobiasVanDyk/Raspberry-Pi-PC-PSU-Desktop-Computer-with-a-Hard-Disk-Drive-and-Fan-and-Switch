(1) Use a 55mm or 60mm 12volt fan from an old HDD cooler. Connect to GPIO +5v and Gnd - most will run at the lower voltage and still keep the CPU at normal use about 20 degrees Celsius above ambient.

(2) Cut the USB - USB - Ethernet supports off.

(3) If a Audio/DAC hat is mounted put the fan on top of the upper lid, else put it below the lid i.e. inside the case

(4) The Pimoroni NVME base needs 10mm nylon standoffs to give the Pi5 the correct height.
