(1) Use a 55mm or 60mm 12volt fan from an old HDD cooler. Connect to GPIO +5v and Gnd - most will run at the lower voltage and still keep the CPU at normal use about 20 degrees Celsius above ambient.

(2) Cut the USB - USB - Ethernet supports off.

(3) If a Audio/DAC hat is mounted put the fan on top of the upper lid, else put it below the lid i.e. inside the case

(4) The Pimoroni NVME base needs 4 x 10mm nylon standoffs to give the Pi5 the correct height. 
Mount it on four washers between the NVME-base and the bottom of the case at the same height as the M2 screw holding the NVME drive down.
The case is wide enough that the entire vertical assembly - from the NVME-base + RPi5 + Hat/Fan - can be done outside the case and then
dropped into the bottom case.
